bitly Firefox Extension
=======================

This is a nonofficial [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) firefox extension. 

It adds a bitly's pupper fish button to the url bar, allowing you to easily save a page to your bitmarks (without having to display the Bookmarks Toolbar).

It is a wrapper around [bitmarklet.js](http://bitly.com/a/bitmarklet.js), used for bitl.y 
[bitmarklet](https://bitly.com/a/tools).


## Building

In order to build it you'll need [Mozilla's Add-on SDK](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/builder). 

This extension depends on the [UrlbarButton](https://github.com/voxpelli/moz-urlbarbutton) lib. 
Read more about using [third-party modules](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/adding-menus.html).
